🌟 **Project Overview**  
The Interactor is a functional prototype of a core social media application feature: a user interface for creating posts and viewing a dynamic feed. Developed as a mini-project for the **CIT305: Social Media Applications** course, it demonstrates key front-end development principles using React and API integration.

The application utilizes modern React components, manages application state for new user posts, and retrieves initial feed data from a public test API.

## ✨ Features

- **Post Creator Form:** A dedicated component allowing users to input text content and an optional image URL for their post.  
- **Dynamic Feed:** Displays a feed combining posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API and newly created posts submitted by the user.  
- **State Management:** New posts are immediately added to the local application state and appear at the top of the feed in real-time.  
- **Reusable Components:** Uses a reusable `SocialPost` component to render individual posts consistently across the feed.  
- **Interactive Post Actions:** Includes functioning Like, Comment (mock functionality), and Share buttons on each post.  
- **Responsiveness:** Designed with a clean, modern layout that is reasonably responsive on desktop and mobile viewports.
